</div>



This repository showcases the **Crossroad Classic Analytics Challenge** project, where participants analyzed data provided by the **NCAA** to develop actionable insights. Our team built a **predictive model in Python** and visualized the results using **Tableau**, combining analytics, visualization, and presentation skills to solve data-driven challenges.

## Tableau Dashboard

Explore our interactive dashboard here:[Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sarah.morrolf/viz/DataDawgsCrossroadsClassicAnalyticsChallenge/Dashboard). The dashboard highlights the key trends, insights, and metrics derived from the data.


## Key Features of the Project:
- **Predictive Modeling:** Built and evaluated a predictive model using Python to forecast outcomes based on the provided NCAA dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to display key insights from the model and the data.
- **Social Media Data Integration:** Gathered secondary data from social media platforms to enrich the analysis and provide a more comprehensive view.
- **Presentation to Industry Experts:** Presented our findings to a panel of judges, including representatives from NCAA, Tableau, and a guest judge.

## Competition Highlights: 
- **Team Competition:** Competed against other teams from top schools, including:
  - Indiana University Bloomington
  - IU Southeast
  - Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
  - Purdue University
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** Worked through complex data issues, including cleaning and transforming datasets to ensure accurate predictions and insights.

## Key Insights
- **Model Accuracy:** Realized that accuracy alone is not sufficient for evaluating predictive modelsâ€”context-specific metrics are essential.
- **Data Cleaning:** Data preparation and cleaning were critical steps in achieving reliable results and meaningful analysis.


## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Python:** Developed the predictive model and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Tableau:** Created a dynamic dashboard to visualize findings and communicate insights effectively.

## About the Challenge
The **Crossroad Classic Analytics Challenge** brings together data enthusiasts and professionals to tackle data problems using advanced analytics and creative visualization. This competition emphasizes **storytelling through data**, encouraging participants to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
